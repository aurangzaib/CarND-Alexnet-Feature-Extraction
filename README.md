This lab guides you through using AlexNet and TensorFlow to build a feature extraction network.

## Setup
Before you start the lab, you should first install:
* Python 3
* TensorFlow
* NumPy
* SciPy

## What to do
In this repo, we have used AlexNeT in two ways:

1- Inference.

2- Feature Extraction.
